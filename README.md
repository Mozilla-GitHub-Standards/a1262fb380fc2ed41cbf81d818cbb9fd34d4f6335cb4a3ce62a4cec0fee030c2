# Application Services Bug Mirror Repo

This is a little experiment in mirroring app-services-related issues
from other github repos/projects/orgs, so that we can have a consistent
way of viewing them in out github-based work planning flow at:

  https://waffle.io/mozilla/application-services

Right now it's just a collection of issues that have been mirror by hand.
If we decide we like it, we could invest in some automation to mirror
issues over automatically, similar to what's uesd in
[fxa-bugzilla-mirror](https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-bugzilla-mirror/).
We could also decide that having a separate repo for this doesn't really
make sense, and just put the issues directly on the main
[application-services](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services)
repo.
